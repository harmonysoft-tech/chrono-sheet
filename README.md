## Overview

This mobile application allows users to track time and save the results directly to their Google Sheets. Users can choose different files for various types of measurements and organize multiple activity categories within a single file. Each day's measurements are recorded in a new row of the designated Google Sheet, making it easy to create charts later that visualize time spent on different activities.
